# audio-events
This is an old project which was used to create the JSON audio events data for [old-music-website](https://github.com/linusced/old-music-website).
You can try it out [here](http://linusced.github.io/audio-events).

# How To Use
You can create an "audio event" by right-clicking in the empty area below the red and green audio waveforms. You can add new keyframes to your event bli left-clicking inside the event box or to the right of it. And you can manually change the keyframes in the "Selected Event" area in the bottom of the page.
